## Which CVs are read from the decoder?
Z2X-Programmer only reads those CVs that are known to Z2X-Programmer. For this reason, Z2X-Programmer creates a list of known CVs before each readout. To do this, Z2X-Programmer opens the selected decoder specification file. All supported features are now collected and the CVs required for them are determined. The CVs required for a function are described on the following page:

https://github.com/PeterK78/Z2X-Programmer/blob/master/Docs/en/SupportedDecoderFeatures_en.md

Once all the required CVs have been recognized, the decoder is read out.
