# Locomotive list

The locomotive list provides quick and easy access to the decoders used.

The locomotive list can be opened by clicking on the Z2X-Programmer icon the flyout menu.

## Configure the locomotive list
Before using the locomotive list for the first time, it must be configured. The path to the Z2X files must be set. In this directory, Z2X-Programmer searches for the Z2X files for the specified vehicle address.

If you are using a train controller software, you can also activate it. However, this is optional.

>[!NOTE]
>Currently only Rocrail is supported.

The locomotive list checks at the start whether a train controller software has been configured. If this is activated, Z2X-Programmer retrieves the locomotive list from this software. If no train controller software is active, Z2X-Programmer reads all Z2X files in the specified directory.

## Select a locomotive

To select a locomotive, select one of the locomotives displayed. Then click on OK. Z2X-Programmer will now open the corresponding Z2X file.
