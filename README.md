# Z2X-Programmer

Z2X-Programmer is an application to configure locomotive and function decoders by using a Roco/Fleischmann Z21 compatible digital command station. 
The application is aimed at beginner level users who want to configure the most essential functions of their decoders in a simple and intuitive way. 

The application is currently in a beta state and therefore only available in German language.

## Overview

The application provides the following features:

*  Configuration of various addresses
*  Configuration of drive properties
*  Configuration of motor properties
*  Configuration of the function keys
*  Configuration of selected sound functions
*  Configuration of selected lighting functions
*  Display of decoder information such as decoder name, software version, etc.
*  Configuration of the protocols
*  Configuration of security functions
*  Maintenance functions
*  etc.



> A detailed list of all supported functions can be found on the following page: [List of supported decoder features](https://github.com/PeterK78/Z2X-Programmer/blob/master/Docs/De/SupportedDecoderFeatures.md).



User-friendliness is supported with the following functions:

* The user interface can switch to dark mode
* A search function helps you to find the functions you need
* Comprehensible descriptions are available for many configuration options

## Supported Decoder Manufacturers
Z2X-Programmer is universal and not limited to a specific decoder manufacturer. The application offers a wide range of configuration options that are available for all decoders. Which configuration options are used by a decoder is defined in a decoder specification file. The following decoder specification files are currently available:

* RCN225 compatible decoders
* ZIMO MS sound decoder
* ZIMO MX sound decoder
* ZIMO MX function decoder
* etc.

You can create your own decoder specification file at any time.
